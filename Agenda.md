# Efficient groundwater modeling using MODFLOW and Python

## Lecturers: Michael Fienen, Joseph Hughes, and Jeremy White
US Geological Survey

## December 16th to 19th  2019
### Centre for Hydrogeology and Geothermics
### University of Neuch√¢tel, Switzerland

The aim of this course is to enable the participants to work efficiently with groundwater models using MODFLOW and FloPy (a python interface).
The course assumes that the participants have some basic knowledge of groundwater modeling.  
It will cover an introduction about MODFLOW and PYTHON in order to allow everyone to start from the basics and will progressively tackle more advanced functionalities and packages, including parameter identification and uncertainty quantification.

## Schedule
The course will start every morning at 9 am and end around 6 pm every day.
### Organization
Participants will work on their own laptop in order to become independent and able to use all the tools by themselves after the course. Software installation instructions will be provided prior to the class.
